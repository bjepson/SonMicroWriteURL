This example writes a URL as an NDEF message to an RFID tag in such a way
that a Nexus S running the NXP TagWriter app can talk to it.

WARNING: I've bricked one Mifare somehow with an early version of this
program. It's probably because I wrote more than 48 bytes and trashed
the last block of sector 1. You probably don't want to use this with
your last Mifare tag, just in case. In other words:

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You'll first need to try out Tom Igoe's Writing to Mifare RFID Tags and
make sure that example works:
http://www.tigoe.net/pcomp/code/Processing/331

Rough notes:

1) Get a Mifare 1K tag.
2) Get a Nexus S.
3) Make sure your Nexus S is running Android 2.3.3 or higher.
4) Install the NXP TagWriter app and erase your tag with it (tap Erase,
   then bring your Mifare tag within range, and confirm the erase
   operation).
5) Run the Processing app (be sure everything is set up like Tom's
   example). When prompted, press a key.
6) Hold the tag to the reader and keep it still until the tag's serial
   number appears. 

At this point, you've probably written the URL to the tag, and you can
try reading it in TagWriter. If not, examine the Processing console
output. The last two commands should be 89, and both error codes should
be 0. If not, then there's probably a problem with your tag or a bug.


NOTE: Step 4 prepares it to use the same authentication key that I use in
this Processing app. What that means is that you'll be able to read the
tag from within NXP TagWriter after you've written to it from Processing.
Hoping I get smart enough to figure out how to use the standard 0xFF
authentication setting, but I think NXP TagWriter has 0xBB hardcoded in
it.
